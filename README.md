GOT video app - Homework 4.

This is a homework assignment that focuses on a video player build.

When you click a Game of Thrones shield, it will scroll to the name of the house and a description of the house. After this information displays, a video for that specific house should show up.

There are unique controls provided to the user when the video player pops up. These controls are rewind 5 seconds, play/pause, and fast forward 5 seconds.

When the video runs out of time, the video player closes automatically.

We used HTML, CSS and Javascript to make this video player. Coding program Atom was used to build the player.

Thanks for Trevor for starting off the video player in class with us. Rest of design by Hillary Strong.
